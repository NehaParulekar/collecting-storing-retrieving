# collecting-storing-retrieving
how to build large-scale information repositories of different types of information objects so that they can be selected, retrieved, and transformed for analytics and discovery, including statistical analysis. Analyzing, how traditional approaches to data storage can be applied alongside modern approaches that use nonrelational data structures. Through case studies, readings on background theory, and hands-on experimentation, learn how to select, plan, and implement storage, search, and retrieval components of large-scale structured and unstructured information repositories. Emphasizes on how to assess and recommend efficient and effective large-scale information storage and retrieval components that provide data scientists with properly structured, accurate, and reliable access to information needed for investigation
